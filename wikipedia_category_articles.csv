artificial intelligence,"artificial intelligence ai refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. such machines may be called ais. high-profile applications of ai include advanced web search engines e.g., google search recommendation systems used by youtube, amazon, and netflix virtual assistants e.g., google assistant, siri, and alexa autonomous vehicles e.g., waymo generative and creative tools e.g., chatgpt and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games e.g., chess and go. however, many ai applications are not perceived as ai ""a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications, often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled ai anymore."" various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. the traditional goals of ai research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. general intelligencethe ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal levelis among the field's long-term goals. to reach these goals, ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. ai also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as ai winters. funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques. this growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in ai and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the ai boom. the emergence of advanced generative ai in the midst of the ai boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of ai and its long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology."
list of programming languages for artificial intelligence,"historically, some programming languages have been specifically designed for artificial intelligence ai applications. nowadays, many general-purpose programming languages also have libraries that can be used to develop ai applications."
actor-critic algorithm,"the actor-critic algorithm ac is a family of reinforcement learning rl algorithms that combine policy-based rl algorithms such as policy gradient methods, and value-based rl algorithms such as value iteration, q-learning, sarsa, and td learning. an ac algorithm consists of two main components an ""actor"" that determines which actions to take according to a policy function, and a ""critic"" that evaluates those actions according to a value function. some ac algorithms are on-policy, some are off-policy. some apply to either continuous or discrete action spaces. some work in both cases."
admissible heuristic,"in computer science, specifically in algorithms related to pathfinding, a heuristic function is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path. in other words, it should act as a lower bound. it is related to the concept of consistent heuristics. while all consistent heuristics are admissible, not all admissible heuristics are consistent."
agentic ai,"agentic ai is a class of artificial intelligence that focuses on autonomous systems that can make decisions and perform tasks without human intervention. the independent systems automatically respond to conditions, to produce process results. the field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems apms, when applied to process automation. applications include software development, customer support, cybersecurity and business intelligence."
.ai,".ai is the internet country code top-level domain cctld for anguilla, a british overseas territory in the caribbean. it is administered by the government of anguilla. it is a popular domain hack with companies and projects related to the artificial intelligence industry ai. google's ad targeting treats .ai as a generic top-level domain gtld because ""users and website owners frequently see the domain as being more generic than country-targeted."" identity digital began managing the domain as of january 2025."
ai alignment,"in the field of artificial intelligence ai, alignment aims to steer ai systems toward a person's or group's intended goals, preferences, or ethical principles. an ai system is considered aligned if it advances the intended objectives. a misaligned ai system pursues unintended objectives. it is often challenging for ai designers to align an ai system because it is difficult for them to specify the full range of desired and undesired behaviors. therefore, ai designers often use simpler proxy goals, such as gaining human approval. but proxy goals can overlook necessary constraints or reward the ai system for merely appearing aligned. ai systems may also find loopholes that allow them to accomplish their proxy goals efficiently but in unintended, sometimes harmful, ways reward hacking. advanced ai systems may develop unwanted instrumental strategies, such as seeking power or survival because such strategies help them achieve their assigned final goals. furthermore, they might develop undesirable emergent goals that could be hard to detect before the system is deployed and encounters new situations and data distributions. empirical research showed in 2024 that advanced large language models llms such as openai o1 or claude 3 sometimes engage in strategic deception to achieve their goals or prevent them from being changed. today, some of these issues affect existing commercial systems such as llms, robots, autonomous vehicles, and social media recommendation engines. some ai researchers argue that more capable future systems will be more severely affected because these problems partially result from high capabilities. many prominent ai researchers and the leadership of major ai companies have argued or asserted that ai is approaching human-like agi and superhuman cognitive capabilities asi, and could endanger human civilization if misaligned. these include ""ai godfathers"" geoffrey hinton and yoshua bengio and the ceos of openai, anthropic, and google deepmind. these risks remain debated. ai alignment is a subfield of ai safety, the study of how to build safe ai systems. other subfields of ai safety include robustness, monitoring, and capability control. research challenges in alignment include instilling complex values in ai, developing honest ai, scalable oversight, auditing and interpreting ai models, and preventing emergent ai behaviors like power-seeking. alignment research has connections to interpretability research, adversarial robustness, anomaly detection, calibrated uncertainty, formal verification, preference learning, safety-critical engineering, game theory, algorithmic fairness, and social sciences."
ai literacy,"ai literacy or artificial intelligence literacy, is the ability to understand, use, monitor, and critically reflect on ai applications. the term usually refers to teaching skills and knowledge to the general public, particularly those who are not adept in ai. some think ai literacy is essential for school and college students, while some professors ban ai in the classroom and from all assignments with stern punishments for using ai, classifying it as cheating. ai is employed in a variety of applications, including self-driving automobiles and virtual assistants. users of these tools should be able to make informed decisions. ai literacy may have an impact students' future employment prospects."
ai nationalism,"ai nationalism is the idea that nations should develop and control their own artificial intelligence technologies to advance their own interests and ensure technological sovereignty. this concept is gaining traction globally, leading countries to implement new laws, form strategic alliances, and invest significantly in domestic ai capabilities."
ai notetaker,"an ai notetaker is a tool using artificial intelligence to take notes during meetings. they are created by tech companies such as microsoft and google by ai transcription services such as otter.ai and fireflies.ai and by smaller firms such as circleback, fathom, granola, and krisp. some business executives send ai notetakers to attend meetings not only to take notes, but also to answer questions on their behalf. the use of ai notetakers raises ethical questions, including recording meetings without the consent of all participants and the possibility that the notetaker will hallucinate and misrepresent what was said during meetings. references"
ai safety,"ai safety is an interdisciplinary field focused on preventing accidents, misuse, or other harmful consequences arising from artificial intelligence ai systems. it encompasses machine ethics and ai alignment, which aim to ensure ai systems are moral and beneficial, as well as monitoring ai systems for risks and enhancing their reliability. the field is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced ai models. beyond technical research, ai safety involves developing norms and policies that promote safety. it gained significant popularity in 2023, with rapid progress in generative ai and public concerns voiced by researchers and ceos about potential dangers. during the 2023 ai safety summit, the united states and the united kingdom both established their own ai safety institute. however, researchers have expressed concern that ai safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of ai capabilities."
ai washing,"ai washing is a deceptive marketing tactic that consists of promoting a product or a service by overstating the role of artificial intelligence ai integration in it. it raises concerns regarding transparency, consumer trust in the ai industry, and compliance with security regulations, potentially hampering legitimate advancements in ai. u.s. securities and exchange commission sec chairman gary gensler compared it to greenwashing. ai washing ranges from the use of buzzwords attached to products such as ""smart"" or ""machine-learning,"" to more blatant cases of companies claiming to have used ai in their products or services, without actually having used ai. the term ""ai washing"" was first defined by the ai now institute, a research institute based at new york university in 2019. however, the act of ai washing had been used earlier in various campaigns trying to attract customers with ""innovative"" products or services."
ai-complete,"in the field of artificial intelligence ai, tasks that are hypothesized to require artificial general intelligence to solve are informally known as ai-complete or ai-hard. calling a problem ai-complete reflects the belief that it cannot be solved by a simple specific algorithm. in the past, problems supposed to be ai-complete included computer vision, natural language understanding, and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real-world problem. ai-complete were notably considered useful for testing the presence of humans, as captchas aim to do, and in computer security to circumvent brute-force attacks."
aiops,"aiops artificial intelligence for it operations refers to the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analytics to automate and enhance data center management. it helps organizations manage complex it environments by detecting, diagnosing, and resolving issues more efficiently than traditional methods."
algorithmic accountability,"algorithmic accountability refers to the allocation of responsibility for the consequences of real-world actions influenced by algorithms used in decision-making processes. ideally, algorithms should be designed to eliminate bias from their decision-making outcomes. this means they ought to evaluate only relevant characteristics of the input data, avoiding distinctions based on attributes that are generally inappropriate in social contexts, such as an individual's ethnicity in legal judgments. however, adherence to this principle is not always guaranteed, and there are instances where individuals may be adversely affected by algorithmic decisions. responsibility for any harm resulting from a machine's decision may lie with the algorithm itself or with the individuals who designed it, particularly if the decision resulted from bias or flawed data analysis inherent in the algorithm's design."
algorithmic party platforms in the united states,"algorithmic party platforms are a recent development in political campaigning where artificial intelligence ai and machine learning are used to shape and adjust party messaging dynamically. unlike traditional platforms that are drafted well before an election, these platforms adapt based on real-time data such as polling results, voter sentiment, and trends on social media. this allows campaigns to remain responsive to emerging issues throughout the election cycle. these platforms rely on predictive analytics to segment voters into smaller, highly specific groups. ai analyzes demographic data, behavioral patterns, and online activities to identify which issues resonate most with each group. campaigns then tailor their messages accordingly, ensuring that different voter segments receive targeted communication. this approach optimizes resources and enhances voter engagement by focusing on relevant issues. during the 2024 u.s. election, campaigns utilized these tools to adjust messaging on-the-fly. for example, the ai firm resonate identified a voter segment labeled ""cyber crusaders,"" consisting of socially conservative yet fiscally liberal individuals. campaigns used this insight to quickly focus outreach and policy discussions around the concerns of this group, demonstrating how ai-driven platforms can influence strategy as events unfold."
algorithmic probability,"in algorithmic information theory, algorithmic probability, also known as solomonoff probability, is a mathematical method of assigning a prior probability to a given observation. it was invented by ray solomonoff in the 1960s. it is used in inductive inference theory and analyses of algorithms. in his general theory of inductive inference, solomonoff uses the method together with bayes' rule to obtain probabilities of prediction for an algorithm's future outputs. in the mathematical formalism used, the observations have the form of finite binary strings viewed as outputs of turing machines, and the universal prior is a probability distribution over the set of finite binary strings calculated from a probability distribution over programs that is, inputs to a universal turing machine. the prior is universal in the turing-computability sense, i.e. no string has zero probability. it is not computable, but it can be approximated. formally, the probability p displaystyle p is not a probability and it is not computable. it is only ""lower semi-computable"" and a ""semi-measure"". by ""semi-measure"", it means that 0 x p x 1 displaystyle 0leq sum xpx1 . that is, the ""probability"" does not actually sum up to one, unlike actual probabilities. this is because some inputs to the turing machine causes it to never halt, which means the probability mass allocated to those inputs is lost. by ""lower semi-computable"", it means there is a turing machine that, given an input string x displaystyle x , can print out a sequence y 1 y 2 displaystyle y1y2cdots that converges to p x displaystyle px from below, but there is no such turing machine that does the same from above."
alignment research center,"the alignment research center arc is a nonprofit research institute based in berkeley, california, dedicated to the alignment of advanced artificial intelligence with human values and priorities. established by former openai researcher paul christiano, arc focuses on recognizing and comprehending the potentially harmful capabilities of present-day ai models."
ameca robot,"ameca is a robotic humanoid created in 2021 by engineered arts, headquarters in falmouth, cornwall, united kingdom. the project commenced in february 2021, and the first public demonstration was at the ces 2022 show in las vegas. ameca's appearance features grey rubber skin on the face and hands, and is specifically designed to appear genderless. in 2024, ameca was moved to edinburgh in the uk to reside at the national robotarium."
andor tree,an andor tree is a graphical representation of the reduction of problems or goals to conjunctions and disjunctions of subproblems or subgoals.
argumentation framework,"in artificial intelligence and related fields, an argumentation framework is a way to deal with contentious information and draw conclusions from it using formalized arguments. in an abstract argumentation framework, entry-level information is a set of abstract arguments that, for instance, represent data or a proposition. conflicts between arguments are represented by a binary relation on the set of arguments. in concrete terms, you represent an argumentation framework with a directed graph such that the nodes are the arguments, and the arrows represent the attack relation. there exist some extensions of the dung's framework, like the logic-based argumentation frameworks or the value-based argumentation frameworks."
artificial brain,"an artificial brain or artificial mind is software and hardware with cognitive abilities similar to those of the animal or human brain. research investigating ""artificial brains"" and brain emulation plays three important roles in science an ongoing attempt by neuroscientists to understand how the human brain works, known as cognitive neuroscience. a thought experiment in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, demonstrating that it is possible, at least in theory, to create a machine that has all the capabilities of a human being. a long-term project to create machines exhibiting behavior comparable to those of animals with complex central nervous system such as mammals and most particularly humans. the ultimate goal of creating a machine exhibiting human-like behavior or intelligence is sometimes called strong ai. an example of the first objective is the project reported by aston university in birmingham, england where researchers are using biological cells to create ""neurospheres"" small clusters of neurons in order to develop new treatments for diseases including alzheimer's, motor neurone and parkinson's disease. the second objective is a reply to arguments such as john searle's chinese room argument, hubert dreyfus's critique of ai or roger penrose's argument in the emperor's new mind. these critics argued that there are aspects of human consciousness or expertise that can not be simulated by machines. one reply to their arguments is that the biological processes inside the brain can be simulated to any degree of accuracy. this reply was made as early as 1950, by alan turing in his classic paper ""computing machinery and intelligence"". the third objective is generally called artificial general intelligence by researchers. however, ray kurzweil prefers the term ""strong ai"". in his book the singularity is near, he focuses on whole brain emulation using conventional computing machines as an approach to implementing artificial brains, and claims on grounds of computer power continuing an exponential growth trend that this could be done by 2025. henry markram, director of the blue brain project which is attempting brain emulation, made a similar claim 2020 at the oxford ted conference in 2009."
artificial consciousness,"artificial consciousness, also known as machine consciousness, synthetic consciousness, or digital consciousness, is the consciousness hypothesized to be possible in artificial intelligence. it is also the corresponding field of study, which draws insights from philosophy of mind, philosophy of artificial intelligence, cognitive science and neuroscience. the same terminology can be used with the term ""sentience"" instead of ""consciousness"" when specifically designating phenomenal consciousness the ability to feel qualia. since sentience involves the ability to experience ethically positive or negative i.e., valenced mental states, it may justify welfare concerns and legal protection, as with animals. some scholars believe that consciousness is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the brain these mechanisms are labeled the neural correlates of consciousness or ncc. some further believe that constructing a system e.g., a computer system that can emulate this ncc interoperation would result in a system that is conscious."
artificial general intelligence,"artificial general intelligence agi is a type of highly autonomous artificial intelligence ai that matches or surpasses human cognitive capabilities across most or all economically valuable work or cognitive labor. this contrasts with narrow ai, which is limited to specific tasks. artificial superintelligence asi, on the other hand, refers to agi that greatly exceeds human cognitive capabilities. agi is considered one of the definitions of strong ai. creating agi is a primary goal of ai research and of companies such as openai, google, and meta. a 2020 survey identified 72 active agi research and development projects across 37 countries. the timeline for achieving agi remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. as of 2023, some argue that it may be possible in years or decades others maintain it might take a century or longer a minority believe it may never be achieved and another minority claims that it is already here. notable ai researcher geoffrey hinton has expressed concerns about the rapid progress towards agi, suggesting it could be achieved sooner than many expect. there is debate on the exact definition of agi and regarding whether modern large language models llms such as gpt-4 are early forms of agi. agi is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. contention exists over whether agi represents an existential risk. many experts on ai have stated that mitigating the risk of human extinction posed by agi should be a global priority. others find the development of agi to be too remote to present such a risk."
artificial intelligence and copyright,"in the 2020s, the rapid advancement of deep learning-based generative artificial intelligence models raised questions about whether copyright infringement occurs when such are trained or used. this includes text-to-image models such as stable diffusion and large language models such as chatgpt. as of 2023, there were several pending u.s. lawsuits challenging the use of copyrighted data to train ai models, with defendants arguing that this falls under fair use. popular deep learning models are trained on mass amounts of media scraped from the internet, often utilizing copyrighted material. when assembling training data, the sourcing of copyrighted works may infringe on the copyright holder's exclusive right to control reproduction, unless covered by exceptions in relevant copyright laws. additionally, using a model's outputs might violate copyright, and the model creator could be accused of vicarious liability and held responsible for that copyright infringement."
artificial intelligence and elections,"as artificial intelligence ai has become more mainstream, there is growing concern about how this will influence elections. potential targets of ai include election processes, election offices, election officials and election vendors."
artificial intelligence arms race,"a military artificial intelligence arms race is an arms race between two or more states to develop and deploy lethal autonomous weapons systems laws. since the mid-2010s, many analysts have noted the emergence of such an arms race between superpowers for better military ai, driven by increasing geopolitical and military tensions. an ai arms race is sometimes placed in the context of an ai cold war between the united states and china."
artificial intelligence content detection,"artificial intelligence detection software aims to determine whether some content text, image, video or audio was generated using artificial intelligence ai. however, the reliability of such software is a topic of debate, and there are concerns about the potential misapplication of ai detection software by educators."
artificial intelligence engineering,"artificial intelligence engineering ai engineering is a technical discipline that focuses on the design, development, and deployment of ai systems. ai engineering involves applying engineering principles and methodologies to create scalable, efficient, and reliable ai-based solutions. it merges aspects of data engineering and software engineering to create real-world applications in diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, autonomous systems, and industrial automation."
artificial intelligence in education,"artificial intelligence in education aied is the application of ai in educational settings. the field combines elements of generative ai, data-driven decision-making, ai ethics, data-privacy and ai literacy. an educator might learn to use these ai systems as tools and generate code, text or rich media or optimize their digital content production. or a governmental body might see ai as an ideological project to normalize centralized power and decision making, while public schools and higher education contend with increasing privatization. the different definitions of aied are contested and can result in confusion about what exactly is being discussed."
artificial intelligence in india,"the artificial intelligence ai market in india is projected to reach 8 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate cagr of over 40 from 2020 to 2025. this growth is part of the broader ai boom, a global period of rapid technological advancements with india being pioneer starting in the early 2010s with nlp based chatbots from haptik, corover.ai, niki.ai and then gaining prominence in the early 2020s based on reinforcement learning, marked by breakthroughs such as generative ai models from openai, krutrim and alphafold by google deepmind. in india, the development of ai has been similarly transformative, with applications in healthcare, finance, and education, bolstered by government initiatives like niti aayog's 2018 national strategy for artificial intelligence. institutions such as indian statistical institute and indian institute of science published breakthrough ai research papers and patents. in india, ai has been used in medical devices, medical reports, predicting advertising marketing results, do product design development, healthcare cognitive testing with diagnostic ai. generative ai is being used by indian brands for product ideation, visual concept development, social post creation. while ai presents significant opportunities for economic growth and social development in india, challenges such as data privacy concerns, skill shortages, and ethical considerations need to be addressed for responsible ai deployment."
artificial intelligence in the 2024 united states presidential election,"artificial intelligence ai has been developed rapidly in recent years, and has been used by groups in the 2024 united states presidential election, as well as foreign groups such as china, russia and iran. there have also been efforts to control the use of generative artificial intelligence, such as those in california."
artificial intelligence industry in china,"the artificial intelligence industry in the people's republic of china is a rapidly developing multi-billion dollar industry. the roots of china's ai development started in the late 1970s following deng xiaoping's economic reforms emphasizing science and technology as the country's primary productive force. the initial stages of china's ai development were slow and encountered significant challenges due to lack of resources and talent. at the beginning china was behind most western countries in terms of ai development. a majority of the research was led by scientists who had received higher education abroad. since 2006, the government of the people's republic of china has steadily developed a national agenda for artificial intelligence development and emerged as one of the leading nations in artificial intelligence research and development. in 2016, the chinese communist party ccp released its thirteenth five-year plan in which it aimed to become a global ai leader by 2030. the state council has a list of ""national ai teams"" including fifteen china-based companies, including baidu, tencent, alibaba, sensetime, and iflytek. each company should lead the development of a designated specialized ai sector in china, such as facial recognition, softwarehardware, and speech recognition. china's rapid ai development has significantly impacted chinese society in many areas, including the socio-economic, military, and political spheres. agriculture, transportation, accommodation and food services, and manufacturing are the top industries that would be the most impacted by further ai deployment. the private sector, university laboratories, and the military are working collaboratively in many aspects as there are few current existing boundaries. in 2021, china published the data security law of the people's republic of china, its first national law addressing ai-related ethical concerns. in october 2022, the united states federal government announced a series of export controls and trade restrictions intended to restrict china's access to advanced computer chips for ai applications. concerns have been raised about the effects of the chinese government's censorship regime on the development of generative artificial intelligence and talent acquisition with state of the country's demographics."
artificial intelligence industry in italy,"the artificial intelligence industry in italy is growing and supports industrial development. in 2024 it reached a new record, reaching 1.2 billion euros with a growth of 58 compared to 2023."
artificial intelligence of things,"the artificial intelligence of things aiot is the combination of artificial intelligence ai technologies with the internet of things iot infrastructure to achieve more efficient iot operations, improve human-machine interactions and enhance data management and analytics. in 2018, kpmg published a foresight study on the future of ai including scenarios until 2040. the analysts describe a scenario in detail where a community of things would see each device also contain its own ai that could link autonomously to other ais to, together, perform tasks intelligently. value creation would be controlled and executed in real-time using swarm intelligence. many industries could be transformed with the application of swarm intelligence, including automotive, cloud, medical, military, research, and technology. in the aiot an important facet is ai being done on some thing. in its purest form this involves performing the ai on the device, i.e. at the edge or edge computing, with no need for external connections. there is no need for an internet in aiot, it is an evolution of the concept of the iot and that is where the comparison ends. the combined power of ai and iot, promises to unlock unrealized customer value in a broad swath of industry verticals such as edge analytics, autonomous vehicles, personalized fitness, remote healthcare, precision agriculture, smart retail, predictive maintenance, and industrial automation."
artificial psychology,"artificial psychology ap has had multiple meanings dating back to 19th century, with recent usage related to artificial intelligence ai. in 1999, zhiliang wang and lun xie presented a theory of artificial psychology based on artificial intelligence. they analyze human psychology using information science research methods and artificial intelligence research to probe deeper into the human mind."
artificial reproduction,"artificial reproduction is the re-creation of life brought about by means other than natural ones. it is new life built by human plans and projects. examples include artificial selection, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, artificial womb, artificial cloning, and kinematic replication. artificial reproduction is one aspect of artificial life. artificial reproduction can be categorized into one of two classes according to its capacity to be self-sufficient non-assisted reproductive technology and assisted reproductive technology. cutting plants' stems and placing them in compost is a form of assisted artificial reproduction, xenobots are an example of a more autonomous type of reproduction, while the artificial womb presented in the movie the matrix illustrates a non assisted hypothetical technology. the idea of artificial reproduction has led to various technologies."
artificial wisdom,"artificial wisdom aw is an artificial intelligence ai system which is able to display the human traits of wisdom and morals while being able to contemplate its own endpoint. artificial wisdom can be described as artificial intelligence reaching the top-level of decision-making when confronted with the most complex challenging situations. the term artificial wisdom is used when the ""intelligence"" is based on more than by chance collecting and interpreting data, but by design enriched with smart and conscience strategies that wise people would use. the goal of artificial wisdom is to create artificial intelligence that can successfully replicate the uniquely human traits of having wisdom and morals as closely as possible. thus, artificial wisdom, must incorporate the ethical and moral considerations of the data it uses. there are also many significant ethical and legal implications of aw which are compounded by the rapid advances in ai and related technologies alongside the lack of the development of ethics, guidelines, and regulations without the oversight of any kind of overarching advisory board. additionally, there are challenges in how to develop, test, and implement aw in real world scenarios. existing tests do not test the internal thought process by which a computer system reaches its conclusion, only the result of said process. when examining computer-aided wisdom the partnership of artificial intelligence and contemplative neuroscience, concerns regarding the future of artificial intelligence shift to a more optimistic viewpoint. this artificial wisdom forms the basis of louis molnar's monographic article on artificial philosophy, where he coined the term and proposes how artificial intelligence might view its place in the grand scheme of things."
asr-complete,"asr-complete is, by analogy to ""np-completeness"" in complexity theory, a term to indicate that the difficulty of a computational problem is equivalent to solving the central automatic speech recognition problem, i.e. recognize and understanding spoken language. unlike ""np-completeness"", this term is typically used informally. such problems are hypothesised to include spoken natural language understanding understanding speech from far-field microphones, i.e. handling the reverbation and background noise these problems are easy for humans to do in fact, they are described directly in terms of imitating humans. some systems can solve very simple restricted versions of these problems, but none can solve them in their full generality."
attributional calculus,"attributional calculus is a logic and representation system defined by ryszard s. michalski. it combines elements of predicate logic, propositional calculus, and multi-valued logic. attributional calculus provides a formal language for natural induction, which is an inductive learning process whose outcomes are in human-readable forms."
australian artificial intelligence institute uts,"the university of technology sydney uts is a public research university located in sydney, new south wales, australia. the university was founded in its current form in 1988, though its origins as a technical institution can be traced back to the 1870s. uts is a founding member of the australian technology network atn, and is a member of universities australia ua and the worldwide universities network wun. the university is organised into 9 faculties and schools, which together administers 130 undergraduate courses and 210 postgraduate courses. in 2023, the university enrolled 47,913 students, including 33,579 undergraduate students. the university is home to over 45 research centres and institutes, who regularly collaborates along with industry and government partners. uts recognises more than 180 different clubs and societies. its varsity sports teams, which is overseen by uts sport, competes in the unisport nationals as well as in standalone national championships throughout the year. as of 2023, the university has over 290,000 alumni across 140 countries."
autognostics,autognostics is a new paradigm that describes the capacity for computer networks to be self-aware. it is considered one of the major components of autonomic networking.
automated machine learning,"automated machine learning automl is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. it is the combination of automation and ml. automl potentially includes every stage from beginning with a raw dataset to building a machine learning model ready for deployment. automl was proposed as an artificial intelligence-based solution to the growing challenge of applying machine learning. the high degree of automation in automl aims to allow non-experts to make use of machine learning models and techniques without requiring them to become experts in machine learning. automating the process of applying machine learning end-to-end additionally offers the advantages of producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform hand-designed models. common techniques used in automl include hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning and neural architecture search."
automated mathematician,"the automated mathematician am is one of the earliest successful discovery systems. it was created by douglas lenat in lisp, and in 1977 led to lenat being awarded the ijcai computers and thought award. am worked by generating and modifying short lisp programs which were then interpreted as defining various mathematical concepts for example, a program that tested equality between the length of two lists was considered to represent the concept of numerical equality, while a program that produced a list whose length was the product of the lengths of two other lists was interpreted as representing the concept of multiplication. the system had elaborate heuristics for choosing which programs to extend and modify, based on the experiences of working mathematicians in solving mathematical problems."
automated medical scribe,"automated medical scribes also called artificial intelligence scribes, ai scribes, digital scribes, virtual scribes, ambient ai scribes, ai documentation assistants, and digitalvirtualsmart clinical assistants are tools for transcribing medical speech, such as patient consultations and dictated medical notes. many also produce summaries of consultations. automated medical scribes based on large language models llms, commonly called ""ai"", short for ""artificial intelligence"" increased drastically in popularity in 2024. there are privacy and antitrust concerns. accuracy concerns also exist, and intensify in situations in which tools try to go beyond transcribing and summarizing, and are asked to format information by its meaning, since llms do not deal well with meaning see weak artificial intelligence. medics using these scribes are generally expected to understand the ethical and legal considerations, and supervise the outputs. the privacy protections of automated medical scribes vary widely. while it is possible to do all the transcription and summarizing locally, with no connection to the internet, most closed-source providers require that data be sent to their own servers over the internet, processed there, and the results sent back as with digital voice assistants. some retailers say their tools use zero-knowledge encryption meaning that the service provider can't access the data. others explicitly say that they use patient data to train their ais, or rent or resell it to third parties the nature of privacy protections used in such situations is unclear, and they are likely not to be fully effective. most providers have not published any safety or utility data in academic journals, and are not responsive to requests from medical researchers studying their products."
automated negotiation,"automated negotiation is a form of interaction in systems that are composed of multiple autonomous agents, in which the aim is to reach agreements through an iterative process of making offers. automated negotiation can be employed for many tasks human negotiators regularly engage in, such as bargaining and joint decision making. the main topics in automated negotiation revolve around the design of protocols and strategies."
autonomic networking,"autonomic networking follows the concept of autonomic computing, an initiative started by ibm in 2001. its ultimate aim is to create self-managing networks to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of the internet and other networks and to enable their further growth, far beyond the size of today."
autonomous agent,an autonomous agent is an artificial intelligence ai system that can perform complex tasks independently.

bayesian programming,"bayesian programming is a formalism and a methodology for having a technique to specify probabilistic models and solve problems when less than the necessary information is available. edwin t. jaynes proposed that probability could be considered as an alternative and an extension of logic for rational reasoning with incomplete and uncertain information. in his founding book probability theory the logic of science he developed this theory and proposed what he called the robot, which was not a physical device, but an inference engine to automate probabilistic reasoninga kind of prolog for probability instead of logic. bayesian programming is a formal and concrete implementation of this ""robot"". bayesian programming may also be seen as an algebraic formalism to specify graphical models such as, for instance, bayesian networks, dynamic bayesian networks, kalman filters or hidden markov models. indeed, bayesian programming is more general than bayesian networks and has a power of expression equivalent to probabilistic factor graphs."
bayesian learning mechanisms,"bayesian learning mechanisms are probabilistic causal models used in computer science to research the fundamental underpinnings of machine learning, and in cognitive neuroscience, to model conceptual development. bayesian learning mechanisms have also been used in economics and cognitive psychology to study social learning in theoretical models of herd behavior."
machine learning,"machine learning ml is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance. ml finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. the application of ml to business problems is known as predictive analytics. statistics and mathematical optimization mathematical programming methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis eda via unsupervised learning. from a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning."
outline of machine learning,"the following outline is provided as an overview of, and topical guide to, machine learning machine learning ml is a subfield of artificial intelligence within computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory. in 1959, arthur samuel defined machine learning as a ""field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"". ml involves the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. these algorithms operate by building a model from a training set of example observations to make data-driven predictions or decisions expressed as outputs, rather than following strictly static program instructions."
80 million tiny images,"80 million tiny images is a dataset intended for training machine learning systems constructed by antonio torralba, rob fergus, and william t. freeman in a collaboration between mit and new york university. it was published in 2008. the dataset has size 760 gb. it contains 79,302,017 3232 pixel color images, scaled down from images scraped from the world wide web over 8 months. the images are classified into 75,062 classes. each class is a non-abstract noun in wordnet. images may appear in more than one class. the dataset was motivated by non-parametric models of neural activations in the visual cortex upon seeing images. the cifar-10 dataset uses a subset of the images in this dataset, but with independently generated labels, as the original labels were not reliable. the cifar-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the cifar-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes."
a logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity,"""a logical calculus of the ideas immanent to nervous activity"" is a 1943 article written by warren mcculloch and walter pitts. the paper, published in the journal the bulletin of mathematical biophysics, proposed a mathematical model of the nervous system as a network of simple logical elements, later known as artificial neurons, or mcculloch-pitts neurons. these neurons receive inputs, perform a weighted sum, and fire an output signal based on a threshold function. by connecting these units in various configurations, mcculloch and pitts demonstrated that their model could perform all logical functions. it is a seminal work in computational neuroscience, computer science, and artificial intelligence. it was a foundational result in automata theory. john von neumann cited it as a significant result."

action model learning,"action model learning sometimes abbreviated action learning is an area of machine learning concerned with creation and modification of software agent's knowledge about effects and preconditions of the actions that can be executed within its environment. this knowledge is usually represented in logic-based action description language and used as the input for automated planners. learning action models is important when goals change. when an agent acted for a while, it can use its accumulated knowledge about actions in the domain to make better decisions. thus, learning action models differs from reinforcement learning. it enables reasoning about actions instead of expensive trials in the world. action model learning is a form of inductive reasoning, where new knowledge is generated based on agent's observations. it differs from standard supervised learning in that correct inputoutput pairs are never presented, nor imprecise action models explicitly corrected. usual motivation for action model learning is the fact that manual specification of action models for planners is often a difficult, time consuming, and error-prone task especially in complex environments."
active learning machine learning,"active learning is a special case of machine learning in which a learning algorithm can interactively query a human user or some other information source, to label new data points with the desired outputs. the human user must possess knowledgeexpertise in the problem domain, including the ability to consultresearch authoritative sources when necessary. in statistics literature, it is sometimes also called optimal experimental design. the information source is also called teacher or oracle. there are situations in which unlabeled data is abundant but manual labeling is expensive. in such a scenario, learning algorithms can actively query the userteacher for labels. this type of iterative supervised learning is called active learning. since the learner chooses the examples, the number of examples to learn a concept can often be much lower than the number required in normal supervised learning. with this approach, there is a risk that the algorithm is overwhelmed by uninformative examples. recent developments are dedicated to multi-label active learning, hybrid active learning and active learning in a single-pass on-line context, combining concepts from the field of machine learning e.g. conflict and ignorance with adaptive, incremental learning policies in the field of online machine learning. using active learning allows for faster development of a machine learning algorithm, when comparative updates would require a quantum or super computer. large-scale active learning projects may benefit from crowdsourcing frameworks such as amazon mechanical turk that include many humans in the active learning loop."
adversarial machine learning,"adversarial machine learning is the study of the attacks on machine learning algorithms, and of the defenses against such attacks. a survey from may 2020 revealed practitioners' common feeling for better protection of machine learning systems in industrial applications. machine learning techniques are mostly designed to work on specific problem sets, under the assumption that the training and test data are generated from the same statistical distribution iid. however, this assumption is often dangerously violated in practical high-stake applications, where users may intentionally supply fabricated data that violates the statistical assumption. most common attacks in adversarial machine learning include evasion attacks, data poisoning attacks, byzantine attacks and model extraction."
aiml development platform,"aiml development platforms, such as pytorch and hugging face, are software ecosystems designed to facilitate the creation, training, deployment, and management of artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml models. these platforms provide tools, frameworks, and infrastructure to streamline workflows for developers, data scientists, and researchers working on ai-driven solutions."
aixi,"aixi is a theoretical mathematical formalism for artificial general intelligence. it combines solomonoff induction with sequential decision theory. aixi was first proposed by marcus hutter in 2000 and several results regarding aixi are proved in hutter's 2005 book universal artificial intelligence. aixi is a reinforcement learning rl agent. it maximizes the expected total rewards received from the environment. intuitively, it simultaneously considers every computable hypothesis or environment. in each time step, it looks at every possible program and evaluates how many rewards that program generates depending on the next action taken. the promised rewards are then weighted by the subjective belief that this program constitutes the true environment. this belief is computed from the length of the program longer programs are considered less likely, in line with occam's razor. aixi then selects the action that has the highest expected total reward in the weighted sum of all these programs."
algorithm selection,"algorithm selection sometimes also called per-instance algorithm selection or offline algorithm selection is a meta-algorithmic technique to choose an algorithm from a portfolio on an instance-by-instance basis. it is motivated by the observation that on many practical problems, different algorithms have different performance characteristics. that is, while one algorithm performs well in some scenarios, it performs poorly in others and vice versa for another algorithm. if we can identify when to use which algorithm, we can optimize for each scenario and improve overall performance. this is what algorithm selection aims to do. the only prerequisite for applying algorithm selection techniques is that there exists or that there can be constructed a set of complementary algorithms."
algorithmic bias,"algorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create ""unfair"" outcomes, such as ""privileging"" one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm. bias can emerge from many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. for example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. this bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. the study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect ""systematic and unfair"" discrimination. this bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the european union's general data protection regulation proposed 2018 and the artificial intelligence act proposed 2021, approved 2024. as algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias, and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations by how features and labels are chosen because of technical limitations of their design or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design. algorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech. it has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. the relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. in many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single ""algorithm"" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service."
algorithmic inference,"algorithmic inference gathers new developments in the statistical inference methods made feasible by the powerful computing devices widely available to any data analyst. cornerstones in this field are computational learning theory, granular computing, bioinformatics, and, long ago, structural probability fraser 1966. the main focus is on the algorithms which compute statistics rooting the study of a random phenomenon, along with the amount of data they must feed on to produce reliable results. this shifts the interest of mathematicians from the study of the distribution laws to the functional properties of the statistics, and the interest of computer scientists from the algorithms for processing data to the information they process."
anomaly detection,"in data analysis, anomaly detection also referred to as outlier detection and sometimes as novelty detection is generally understood to be the identification of rare items, events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal behavior. such examples may arouse suspicions of being generated by a different mechanism, or appear inconsistent with the remainder of that set of data. anomaly detection finds application in many domains including cybersecurity, medicine, machine vision, statistics, neuroscience, law enforcement and financial fraud to name only a few. anomalies were initially searched for clear rejection or omission from the data to aid statistical analysis, for example to compute the mean or standard deviation. they were also removed to better predictions from models such as linear regression, and more recently their removal aids the performance of machine learning algorithms. however, in many applications anomalies themselves are of interest and are the observations most desirous in the entire data set, which need to be identified and separated from noise or irrelevant outliers. three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" and involves training a classifier. however, this approach is rarely used in anomaly detection due to the general unavailability of labelled data and the inherent unbalanced nature of the classes. semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques assume that some portion of the data is labelled. this may be any combination of the normal or anomalous data, but more often than not, the techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set, and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. unsupervised anomaly detection techniques assume the data is unlabelled and are by far the most commonly used due to their wider and relevant application."
aporia company,"aporia is a machine learning observability platform based in tel aviv, israel. the company has a us office located in san jose, california. aporia has developed software for monitoring and controlling undetected defects and failures used by other companies to detect and report anomalies, and warn in the early stages of faults."
apprenticeship learning,"in artificial intelligence, apprenticeship learning or learning from demonstration or imitation learning is the process of learning by observing an expert. it can be viewed as a form of supervised learning, where the training dataset consists of task executions by a demonstration teacher."
artificial intelligence in hiring,"artificial intelligence can be used to automate aspects of the job recruitment process. advances in artificial intelligence, such as the advent of machine learning and the growth of big data, enable ai to be utilized to recruit, screen, and predict the success of applicants. proponents of artificial intelligence in hiring claim it reduces bias, assists with finding qualified candidates, and frees up human resource workers' time for other tasks, while opponents worry that ai perpetuates inequalities in the workplace and will eliminate jobs. despite the potential benefits, the ethical implications of ai in hiring remain a subject of debate, with concerns about algorithmic transparency, accountability, and the need for ongoing oversight to ensure fair and unbiased decision-making throughout the recruitment process."
astrostatistics,"astrostatistics is a discipline which spans astrophysics, statistical analysis and data mining. it is used to process the vast amount of data produced by automated scanning of the cosmos, to characterize complex datasets, and to link astronomical data to astrophysical theory. many branches of statistics are involved in astronomical analysis including nonparametrics, multivariate regression and multivariate classification, time series analysis, and especially bayesian inference. the field is closely related to astroinformatics. references"
attention machine learning,"attention is a machine learning method that determines the relative importance of each component in a sequence relative to the other components in that sequence. in natural language processing, importance is represented by ""soft"" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. more generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size. unlike ""hard"" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, ""soft"" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network rnn language translation system, but a more recent design, namely the transformer, removed the slower sequential rnn and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme. inspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. attention allows a token equal access to any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state."
audio inpainting,"audio inpainting also known as audio interpolation is an audio restoration task which deals with the reconstruction of missing or corrupted portions of a digital audio signal. inpainting techniques are employed when parts of the audio have been lost due to various factors such as transmission errors, data corruption or errors during recording. the goal of audio inpainting is to fill in the gaps i.e., the missing portions in the audio signal seamlessly, making the reconstructed portions indistinguishable from the original content and avoiding the introduction of audible distortions or alterations. many techniques have been proposed to solve the audio inpainting problem and this is usually achieved by analyzing the temporal and spectral information surrounding each missing portion of the considered audio signal. classic methods employ statistical models or digital signal processing algorithms to predict and synthesize the missing or damaged sections. recent solutions, instead, take advantage of deep learning models, thanks to the growing trend of exploiting data-driven methods in the context of audio restoration. depending on the extent of the lost information, the inpainting task can be divided in three categories. short inpainting refers to the reconstruction of few milliseconds approximately less than 10 of missing signal, that occurs in the case of short distortions such as clicks or clipping. in this case, the goal of the reconstruction is to recover the lost information exactly. in long inpainting instead, with gaps in the order of hundreds of milliseconds or even seconds, this goal becomes unrealistic, since restoration techniques cannot rely on local information. therefore, besides providing a coherent reconstruction, the algorithms need to generate new information that has to be semantically compatible with the surrounding context i.e., the audio signal surrounding the gaps. the case of medium duration gaps lays between short and long inpainting. it refers to the reconstruction of tens of millisecond of missing data, a scale where the non-stationary characteristic of audio already becomes important."
automated decision-making,"automated decision-making adm involves the use of data, machines and algorithms to make decisions in a range of contexts, including public administration, business, health, education, law, employment, transport, media and entertainment, with varying degrees of human oversight or intervention. adm involves large-scale data from a range of sources, such as databases, text, social media, sensors, images or speech, that is processed using various technologies including computer software, algorithms, machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, augmented intelligence and robotics. the increasing use of automated decision-making systems adms across a range of contexts presents many benefits and challenges to human society requiring consideration of the technical, legal, ethical, societal, educational, economic and health consequences."
automation in construction,"automation in construction is the combination of methods, processes, and systems that allow for greater machine autonomy in construction activities. construction automation may have multiple goals, including but not limited to, reducing jobsite injuries, decreasing activity completion times, and assisting with quality control and quality assurance. some systems may be fielded as a direct response to increasing skilled labor shortages in some countries. opponents claim that increased automation may lead to less construction jobs and that software leaves heavy equipment vulnerable to hackers. research insights on this subject are today published in several jurnals such as automation in construction by elsevier."
bag-of-words model,"the bag-of-words model bow is a model of text which uses an unordered collection a ""bag"" of words. it is used in natural language processing and information retrieval ir. it disregards word order and thus most of syntax or grammar but captures multiplicity. the bag-of-words model is commonly used in methods of document classification where, for example, the frequency of occurrence of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier. it has also been used for computer vision. an early reference to ""bag of words"" in a linguistic context can be found in zellig harris's 1954 article on distributional structure."
ball tree,"in computer science, a ball tree, balltree or metric tree, is a space partitioning data structure for organizing points in a multi-dimensional space. a ball tree partitions data points into a nested set of balls. the resulting data structure has characteristics that make it useful for a number of applications, most notably nearest neighbor search."
base rate,"in probability and statistics, the base rate also known as prior probabilities is the class of probabilities unconditional on ""featural evidence"" likelihoods. it is the proportion of individuals in a population who have a certain characteristic or trait. for example, if 1 of the population were medical professionals, and remaining 99 were not medical professionals, then the base rate of medical professionals is 1. the method for integrating base rates and featural evidence is given by bayes' rule. in the sciences, including medicine, the base rate is critical for comparison. in medicine a treatment's effectiveness is clear when the base rate is available. for example, if the control group, using no treatment at all, had their own base rate of 120 recoveries within 1 day and a treatment had a 1100 base rate of recovery within 1 day, we see that the treatment actively decreases the recovery. the base rate is an important concept in statistical inference, particularly in bayesian statistics. in bayesian analysis, the base rate is combined with the observed data to update our belief about the probability of the characteristic or trait of interest. the updated probability is known as the posterior probability and is denoted as pab, where b represents the observed data. for example, suppose we are interested in estimating the prevalence of a disease in a population. the base rate would be the proportion of individuals in the population who have the disease. if we observe a positive test result for a particular individual, we can use bayesian analysis to update our belief about the probability that the individual has the disease. the updated probability would be a combination of the base rate and the likelihood of the test result given the disease status. the base rate is also important in decision-making, particularly in situations where the cost of false positives and false negatives are different. for example, in medical testing, a false negative failing to diagnose a disease could be much more costly than a false positive incorrectly diagnosing a disease. in such cases, the base rate can help inform decisions about the appropriate threshold for a positive test result."
bayesian interpretation of kernel regularization,"within bayesian statistics for machine learning, kernel methods arise from the assumption of an inner product space or similarity structure on inputs. for some such methods, such as support vector machines svms, the original formulation and its regularization were not bayesian in nature. it is helpful to understand them from a bayesian perspective. because the kernels are not necessarily positive semidefinite, the underlying structure may not be inner product spaces, but instead more general reproducing kernel hilbert spaces. in bayesian probability kernel methods are a key component of gaussian processes, where the kernel function is known as the covariance function. kernel methods have traditionally been used in supervised learning problems where the input space is usually a space of vectors while the output space is a space of scalars. more recently these methods have been extended to problems that deal with multiple outputs such as in multi-task learning. a mathematical equivalence between the regularization and the bayesian point of view is easily proved in cases where the reproducing kernel hilbert space is finite-dimensional. the infinite-dimensional case raises subtle mathematical issues we will consider here the finite-dimensional case. we start with a brief review of the main ideas underlying kernel methods for scalar learning, and briefly introduce the concepts of regularization and gaussian processes. we then show how both points of view arrive at essentially equivalent estimators, and show the connection that ties them together."
bayesian optimization,"bayesian optimization is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functions, that does not assume any functional forms. it is usually employed to optimize expensive-to-evaluate functions. with the rise of artificial intelligence innovation in the 21st century, bayesian optimizations have found prominent use in machine learning problems for optimizing hyperparameter values."
bayesian regret,"in stochastic game theory, bayesian regret is the expected difference ""regret"" between the utility of a bayesian strategy and that of the optimal strategy the one with the highest expected payoff. the term bayesian refers to thomas bayes 17021761, who proved a special case of what is now called bayes' theorem, who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical data analysis using what is now known as bayesian inference."
bayesian structural time series,"bayesian structural time series bsts model is a statistical technique used for feature selection, time series forecasting, nowcasting, inferring causal impact and other applications. the model is designed to work with time series data. the model has also promising application in the field of analytical marketing. in particular, it can be used in order to assess how much different marketing campaigns have contributed to the change in web search volumes, product sales, brand popularity and other relevant indicators. difference-in-differences models and interrupted time series designs are alternatives to this approach. ""in contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to i infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, ii incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully bayesian treatment, and iii flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates, i.e., synthetic controls."""
biasvariance tradeoff,"in statistics and machine learning, the biasvariance tradeoff describes the relationship between a model's complexity, the accuracy of its predictions, and how well it can make predictions on previously unseen data that were not used to train the model. in general, as we increase the number of tunable parameters in a model, it becomes more flexible, and can better fit a training data set. it is said to have lower error, or bias. however, for more flexible models, there will tend to be greater variance to the model fit each time we take a set of samples to create a new training data set. it is said that there is greater variance in the model's estimated parameters. the biasvariance dilemma or biasvariance problem is the conflict in trying to simultaneously minimize these two sources of error that prevent supervised learning algorithms from generalizing beyond their training set the bias error is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm. high bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs underfitting. the variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. high variance may result from an algorithm modeling the random noise in the training data overfitting. the biasvariance decomposition is a way of analyzing a learning algorithm's expected generalization error with respect to a particular problem as a sum of three terms, the bias, variance, and a quantity called the irreducible error, resulting from noise in the problem itself."
binary classification,"binary classification is the task of classifying the elements of a set into one of two groups each called class. typical binary classification problems include medical testing to determine if a patient has a certain disease or not quality control in industry, deciding whether a specification has been met in information retrieval, deciding whether a page should be in the result set of a search or not in administration, deciding whether someone should be issued with a driving licence or not in cognition, deciding whether an object is food or not food. when measuring the accuracy of a binary classifier, the simplest way is to count the errors. but in the real world often one of the two classes is more important, so that the number of both of the different types of errors is of interest. for example, in medical testing, detecting a disease when it is not present a false positive is considered differently from not detecting a disease when it is present a false negative."
bioserenity,"bioserenity is a medtech company created in 2014 that develops ambulatory medical devices to help diagnose and monitor patients with chronic diseases such as epilepsy. the medical devices are composed of medical sensors, smart clothing, a smartphone app for patient reported outcome, and a web platform to perform data analysis through medical artificial intelligence for detection of digital biomarkers. the company initially focused on neurology, a domain in which it reported contributing to the diagnosis of 30 000 patients per year. it now also operates in sleep disorders and cardiology. bioserenity reported it provides pharmaceutical companies with solutions for companion diagnostics."
bradleyterry model,"the bradleyterry model is a probability model for the outcome of pairwise comparisons between items, teams, or objects. given a pair of items i and j drawn from some population, it estimates the probability that the pairwise comparison i j turns out true, as where pi is a positive real-valued score assigned to individual i. the comparison i j can be read as ""i is preferred to j"", ""i ranks higher than j"", or ""i beats j"", depending on the application. for example, pi might represent the skill of a team in a sports tournament and pr i j displaystyle prij the probability that i wins a game against j. or pi might represent the quality or desirability of a commercial product and pr i j displaystyle prij the probability that a consumer will prefer product i over product j. the bradleyterry model can be used in the forward direction to predict outcomes, as described, but is more commonly used in reverse to infer the scores pi given an observed set of outcomes. in this type of application pi represents some measure of the strength or quality of i displaystyle i and the model lets us estimate the strengths from a series of pairwise comparisons. in a survey of wine preferences, for instance, it might be difficult for respondents to give a complete ranking of a large set of wines, but relatively easy for them to compare sample pairs of wines and say which they feel is better. based on a set of such pairwise comparisons, the bradleyterry model can then be used to derive a full ranking of the wines. once the values of the scores pi have been calculated, the model can then also be used in the forward direction, for instance to predict the likely outcome of comparisons that have not yet actually occurred. in the wine survey example, for instance, one could calculate the probability that someone will prefer wine i displaystyle i over wine j displaystyle j , even if no one in the survey directly compared that particular pair."
category utility,"category utility is a measure of ""category goodness"" defined in gluck corter 1985 and corter gluck 1992. it attempts to maximize both the probability that two objects in the same category have attribute values in common, and the probability that objects from different categories have different attribute values. it was intended to supersede more limited measures of category goodness such as ""cue validity"" reed 1972 rosch mervis 1975 and ""collocation index"" jones 1983. it provides a normative information-theoretic measure of the predictive advantage gained by the observer who possesses knowledge of the given category structure i.e., the class labels of instances over the observer who does not possess knowledge of the category structure. in this sense the motivation for the category utility measure is similar to the information gain metric used in decision tree learning. in certain presentations, it is also formally equivalent to the mutual information, as discussed below. a review of category utility in its probabilistic incarnation, with applications to machine learning, is provided in witten frank 2005, pp. 260262."

cognitive robotics,"cognitive robotics or cognitive technology is a subfield of robotics concerned with endowing a robot with intelligent behavior by providing it with a processing architecture that will allow it to learn and reason about how to behave in response to complex goals in a complex world. cognitive robotics may be considered the engineering branch of embodied cognitive science and embodied embedded cognition, consisting of robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, optical character recognition, image processing, process mining, analytics, software development and system integration."
concept drift,"in predictive analytics, data science, machine learning and related fields, concept drift or drift is an evolution of data that invalidates the data model. it happens when the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforeseen ways. this causes problems because the predictions become less accurate as time passes. drift detection and drift adaptation are of paramount importance in the fields that involve dynamically changing data and data models."
conditional random field,"conditional random fields crfs are a class of statistical modeling methods often applied in pattern recognition and machine learning and used for structured prediction. whereas a classifier predicts a label for a single sample without considering ""neighbouring"" samples, a crf can take context into account. to do so, the predictions are modelled as a graphical model, which represents the presence of dependencies between the predictions. the kind of graph used depends on the application. for example, in natural language processing, ""linear chain"" crfs are popular, for which each prediction is dependent only on its immediate neighbours. in image processing, the graph typically connects locations to nearby andor similar locations to enforce that they receive similar predictions. other examples where crfs are used are labeling or parsing of sequential data for natural language processing or biological sequences, part-of-speech tagging, shallow parsing, named entity recognition, gene finding, peptide critical functional region finding, and object recognition and image segmentation in computer vision."
confusion matrix,"in the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification, a confusion matrix, also known as error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one in unsupervised learning it is usually called a matching matrix. each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class, or vice versa both variants are found in the literature. the diagonal of the matrix therefore represents all instances that are correctly predicted. the name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see whether the system is confusing two classes i.e. commonly mislabeling one as another. it is a special kind of contingency table, with two dimensions ""actual"" and ""predicted"", and identical sets of ""classes"" in both dimensions each combination of dimension and class is a variable in the contingency table."
contrastive language-image pre-training,"contrastive language-image pre-training clip is a technique for training a pair of neural network models, one for image understanding and one for text understanding, using a contrastive objective. this method has enabled broad applications across multiple domains, including cross-modal retrieval, text-to-image generation, aesthetic ranking, and image captioning."
cost-sensitive machine learning,"cost-sensitive machine learning is an approach within machine learning that considers varying costs associated with different types of errors. this method diverges from traditional approaches by introducing a cost matrix, explicitly specifying the penalties or benefits for each type of prediction error. the inherent difficulty which cost-sensitive machine learning tackles is that minimizing different kinds of classification errors is a multi-objective optimization problem."
coupled pattern learner,coupled pattern learner cpl is a machine learning algorithm which couples the semi-supervised learning of categories and relations to forestall the problem of semantic drift associated with boot-strap learning methods.
cross-entropy method,"the cross-entropy ce method is a monte carlo method for importance sampling and optimization. it is applicable to both combinatorial and continuous problems, with either a static or noisy objective. the method approximates the optimal importance sampling estimator by repeating two phases draw a sample from a probability distribution. minimize the cross-entropy between this distribution and a target distribution to produce a better sample in the next iteration. reuven rubinstein developed the method in the context of rare-event simulation, where tiny probabilities must be estimated, for example in network reliability analysis, queueing models, or performance analysis of telecommunication systems. the method has also been applied to the traveling salesman, quadratic assignment, dna sequence alignment, max-cut and buffer allocation problems."
cross-validation statistics,"cross-validation, sometimes called rotation estimation or out-of-sample testing, is any of various similar model validation techniques for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. cross-validation includes resampling and sample splitting methods that use different portions of the data to test and train a model on different iterations. it is often used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice. it can also be used to assess the quality of a fitted model and the stability of its parameters. in a prediction problem, a model is usually given a dataset of known data on which training is run training dataset, and a dataset of unknown data or first seen data against which the model is tested called the validation dataset or testing set. the goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias and to give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem. one round of cross-validation involves partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset called the training set, and validating the analysis on the other subset called the validation set or testing set. to reduce variability, in most methods multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions, and the validation results are combined e.g. averaged over the rounds to give an estimate of the model's predictive performance. in summary, cross-validation combines averages measures of fitness in prediction to derive a more accurate estimate of model prediction performance."
curse of dimensionality,"the curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. the expression was coined by richard e. bellman when considering problems in dynamic programming. the curse generally refers to issues that arise when the number of datapoints is small in a suitably defined sense relative to the intrinsic dimension of the data. dimensionally cursed phenomena occur in domains such as numerical analysis, sampling, combinatorics, machine learning, data mining and databases. the common theme of these problems is that when the dimensionality increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data become sparse. in order to obtain a reliable result, the amount of data needed often grows exponentially with the dimensionality. also, organizing and searching data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties in high dimensional data, however, all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar in many ways, which prevents common data organization strategies from being efficient."
computer vision,"computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the form of decisions. ""understanding"" in this context signifies the transformation of visual images the input to the retina into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. this image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory. the scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multi-dimensional data from a 3d scanner, 3d point clouds from lidar sensors, or medical scanning devices. the technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems. subdisciplines of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, activity recognition, video tracking, object recognition, 3d pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, 3d scene modeling, and image restoration."
outline of computer vision,"the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to computer vision computer vision interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. from the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring digital images through image sensors, image processing, and image analysis, to reach an understanding of digital images. in general, it deals with the extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information that the computer can interpret. the image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner. as a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems. as a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images."
spatial verification,"spatial verification is a technique in which similar locations can be identified in an automated way through a sequence of images. the general method involves identifying a correlation between certain points among sets images, using techniques similar to those used for image registration. the main problem is that outliers that does not fit or does not match the selected model affect adjustment called least squares numerical analysis technique framed in mathematical optimization, which, given an set of ordered pairs independent variable, dependent variable, and a family of functions, try to find the continuous function."
3d body scanning,"3d body scanning is an application of various technologies such as structured-light 3d scanner, 3d depth sensing, stereoscopic vision and others for ergonomic and anthropometric investigation of the human form as a point-cloud. the technology and practice within research has found 3d body scanning measurement extraction methodologies to be comparable to traditional anthropometric measurement techniques."
3d morphable model,"in computer vision and computer graphics, the 3d morphable model 3dmm is a generative technique that uses methods of statistical shape analysis to model 3d objects. the model follows an analysis-by-synthesis approach over a dataset of 3d example shapes of a single class of objects e.g., face, hand. the main prerequisite is that all the 3d shapes are in a dense point-to-point correspondence, namely each point has the same semantical meaning over all the shapes. in this way, we can extract meaningful statistics from the dataset and use it to represent new plausible shapes of the object's class. given a 2d image, we can represent its 3d shape via a fitting process or generate novel shapes by directly sampling from the statistical shape distribution of that class. the question that initiated the research on 3dmms was to understand how a visual system could handle the vast variety of images produced by a single class of objects and how these can be represented. the primary assumption in developing 3dmms was that prior knowledge about object classes was crucial in vision. 3d face morphable models are the most popular 3dmms since they were the first to be developed in the field of facial recognition. it has also been applied to the whole human body, the hand, the ear, cars, and animals."
3d pose estimation,"3d pose estimation is a process of predicting the transformation of an object from a user-defined reference pose, given an image or a 3d scan. it arises in computer vision or robotics where the pose or transformation of an object can be used for alignment of a computer-aided design models, identification, grasping, or manipulation of the object. the image data from which the pose of an object is determined can be either a single image, a stereo image pair, or an image sequence where, typically, the camera is moving with a known velocity. the objects which are considered can be rather general, including a living being or body parts, e.g., a head or hands. the methods which are used for determining the pose of an object, however, are usually specific for a class of objects and cannot generally be expected to work well for other types of objects."
3d reconstruction,"in computer vision and computer graphics, 3d reconstruction is the process of capturing the shape and appearance of real objects. this process can be accomplished either by active or passive methods. if the model is allowed to change its shape in time, this is referred to as non-rigid or spatio-temporal reconstruction."
3d reconstruction from multiple images,"3d reconstruction from multiple images is the creation of three-dimensional models from a set of images. it is the reverse process of obtaining 2d images from 3d scenes. the essence of an image is a projection from a 3d scene onto a 2d plane, during which process the depth is lost. the 3d point corresponding to a specific image point is constrained to be on the line of sight. from a single image, it is impossible to determine which point on this line corresponds to the image point. if two images are available, then the position of a 3d point can be found as the intersection of the two projection rays. this process is referred to as triangulation. the key for this process is the relations between multiple views which convey the information that corresponding sets of points must contain some structure and that this structure is related to the poses and the calibration of the camera. in recent decades, there is an important demand for 3d content for computer graphics, virtual reality and communication, triggering a change in emphasis for the requirements. many existing systems for constructing 3d models are built around specialized hardware e.g. stereo rigs resulting in a high cost, which cannot satisfy the requirement of its new applications. this gap stimulates the use of digital imaging facilities like a camera. an early method was proposed by tomasi and kanade. they used an affine factorization approach to extract 3d from images sequences. however, the assumption of orthographic projection is a significant limitation of this system."
3d scanning,"3d scanning is the process of analyzing a real-world object or environment to collect three dimensional data of its shape and possibly its appearance e.g. color. the collected data can then be used to construct digital 3d models. a 3d scanner can be based on many different technologies, each with its own limitations, advantages and costs. many limitations in the kind of objects that can be digitised are still present. for example, optical technology may encounter many difficulties with dark, shiny, reflective or transparent objects. for example, industrial computed tomography scanning, structured-light 3d scanners, lidar and time of flight 3d scanners can be used to construct digital 3d models, without destructive testing. collected 3d data is useful for a wide variety of applications. these devices are used extensively by the entertainment industry in the production of movies and video games, including virtual reality. other common applications of this technology include augmented reality, motion capture, gesture recognition, robotic mapping, industrial design, orthotics and prosthetics, reverse engineering and prototyping, quality controlinspection and the digitization of cultural artifacts."
3d selfie,"a 3d selfie is a 3d-printed scale replica of a person or their face. these three-dimensional selfies are also known as 3d portraits, 3d figurines, 3d-printed figurines, mini-me figurines and miniature statues. in 2014 a first 3d printed bust of a president, barack obama, was made. 3d-digital-imaging specialists used handheld 3d scanners to create an accurate representation of the president."
active appearance model,"an active appearance model aam is a computer vision algorithm for matching a statistical model of object shape and appearance to a new image. they are built during a training phase. a set of images, together with coordinates of landmarks that appear in all of the images, is provided to the training supervisor. the model was first introduced by edwards, cootes and taylor in the context of face analysis at the 3rd international conference on face and gesture recognition, 1998. cootes, edwards and taylor further described the approach as a general method in computer vision at the european conference on computer vision in the same year. the approach is widely used for matching and tracking faces and for medical image interpretation. the algorithm uses the difference between the current estimate of appearance and the target image to drive an optimization process. by taking advantage of the least squares techniques, it can match to new images very swiftly. it is related to the active shape model asm. one disadvantage of asm is that it only uses shape constraints together with some information about the image structure near the landmarks, and does not take advantage of all the available information the texture across the target object. this can be modelled using an aam."
active contour model,"active contour model, also called snakes, is a framework in computer vision introduced by michael kass, andrew witkin, and demetri terzopoulos for delineating an object outline from a possibly noisy 2d image. the snakes model is popular in computer vision, and snakes are widely used in applications like object tracking, shape recognition, segmentation, edge detection and stereo matching. a snake is an energy minimizing, deformable spline influenced by constraint and image forces that pull it towards object contours and internal forces that resist deformation. snakes may be understood as a special case of the general technique of matching a deformable model to an image by means of energy minimization. in two dimensions, the active shape model represents a discrete version of this approach, taking advantage of the point distribution model to restrict the shape range to an explicit domain learnt from a training set. snakes do not solve the entire problem of finding contours in images, since the method requires knowledge of the desired contour shape beforehand. rather, they depend on other mechanisms such as interaction with a user, interaction with some higher level image understanding process, or information from image data adjacent in time or space."
active shape model,"active shape models asms are statistical models of the shape of objects which iteratively deform to fit to an example of the object in a new image, developed by tim cootes and chris taylor in 1995. the shapes are constrained by the pdm point distribution model statistical shape model to vary only in ways seen in a training set of labelled examples. the shape of an object is represented by a set of points controlled by the shape model. the asm algorithm aims to match the model to a new image. the asm works by alternating the following steps generate a suggested shape by looking in the image around each point for a better position for the point. this is commonly done using what is called a ""profile model"", which looks for strong edges or uses the mahalanobis distance to match a model template for the point. conform the suggested shape to the point distribution model, commonly called a ""shape model"" in this context. the figure to the right shows an example. the technique has been widely used to analyse images of faces, mechanical assemblies and medical images in 2d and 3d. it is closely related to the active appearance model. it is also known as a ""smart snakes"" method, since it is an analog to an active contour model which would respect explicit shape constraints."
active vision,"an area of computer vision is active vision, sometimes also called active computer vision. an active vision system is one that can manipulate the viewpoint of the cameras in order to investigate the environment and get better information from it."
alignments of random points,"the study of alignments of random points in a plane seeks to discover subsets of points that occupy an approximately straight line within a larger set of points that are randomly placed in a planar region. studies have shown that such near-alignments occur by chance with greater frequency than one might intuitively expect. this has been put forward as a demonstration that ley lines and other similar mysterious alignments believed by some to be phenomena of deep significance might exist solely due to chance alone, as opposed to the supernatural or anthropological explanations put forward by their proponents. the topic has also been studied in the fields of computer vision and astronomy. a number of studies have examined the mathematics of alignment of random points on the plane. in all of these, the width of the line the allowed displacement of the positions of the points from a perfect straight line is important. it allows the fact that real-world features are not mathematical points, and that their positions need not line up exactly for them to be considered in alignment. alfred watkins, in his classic work on ley lines the old straight track, used the width of a pencil line on a map as the threshold for the tolerance of what might be regarded as an alignment. for example, using a 1 mm pencil line to draw alignments on a 150,000 scale ordnance survey map, the corresponding width on the ground would be 50 m."
articulated body pose estimation,"in computer vision, articulated body pose estimation is the task of algorithmically determining the pose of a body composed of connected parts joints and rigid parts from image or video data. this challenging problem, central to enabling robots and other systems to understand human actions and interactions, has been a long-standing research area due to the complexity of modeling the relationship between visual observations and pose, as well as the wide range of applications."
automated imaging association,"automated imaging association aia is the world's largest machine vision trade group. aia has more than 350 members from 32 countries, including system integrators, camera, lighting and other vision components manufacturers, vision software providers, oems and distributors. the association's headquarters is located in ann arbor, michigan. now part of the a3 the association for advancing automation aia joins ria robotic industries association, mcma, motion control motor association and a3 mexico to form one of the largest collaborative trade association. all organizations offer industry training, news and member benefits."
background subtraction,"foreground detection is one of the major tasks in the field of computer vision and image processing whose aim is to detect changes in image sequences. background subtraction is any technique which allows an image's foreground to be extracted for further processing object recognition etc.. many applications do not need to know everything about the evolution of movement in a video sequence, but only require the information of changes in the scene, because an image's regions of interest are objects humans, cars, text etc. in its foreground. after the stage of image preprocessing which may include image denoising, post processing like morphology etc. object localisation is required which may make use of this technique. foreground detection separates foreground from background based on these changes taking place in the foreground. it is a set of techniques that typically analyze video sequences recorded in real time with a stationary camera."
binocular disparity,"binocular disparity refers to the difference in image location of an object seen by the left and right eyes, resulting from the eyes' horizontal separation parallax. the mind uses binocular disparity to extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal images in stereopsis. in computer vision, binocular disparity refers to the difference in coordinates of similar features within two stereo images. a similar disparity can be used in rangefinding by a coincidence rangefinder to determine distance andor altitude to a target. in astronomy, the disparity between different locations on the earth can be used to determine various celestial parallax, and earth's orbit can be used for stellar parallax."
birchfieldtomasi dissimilarity,"in computer vision, the birchfieldtomasi dissimilarity is a pixelwise image dissimilarity measure that is robust with respect to sampling effects. in the comparison of two image elements, it fits the intensity of one pixel to the linearly interpolated intensity around a corresponding pixel on the other image. it is used as a dissimilarity measure in stereo matching, where one-dimensional search for correspondences is performed to recover a dense disparity map from a stereo image pair."
boustrophedon cell decomposition,"the boustrophedon cell decomposition bcd is a method used in artificial intelligence and robotics for configuration space solutions. like other cellular decomposition methods, this method transforms the configuration space into cell regions that can be used for path planning. a strength of the boustrophedon cell decomposition is that it allows for more diverse, non-polygonal obstacles within a configuration space. the representation still depicts polygonal obstacles, but the representations are complex enough that they are very effective when describing things like rounded surfaces, jagged edges, etc. it is a goal of the method to optimize a path that can be chosen by an intelligent system. while a bcd can represent the existence of objects in a physical space, it does very little to nothing in terms of recognizing the objects. this would be done using another method, one which most likely requires additional sensory data in order to be used. references"
captcha,"a captcha kap-ch is a type of challengeresponse test used in computing to determine whether the user is human in order to deter bot attacks and spam. the term was coined in 2003 by luis von ahn, manuel blum, nicholas j. hopper, and john langford. it is a contrived acronym for ""completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart."" a historically common type of captcha displayed as recaptcha v1 was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel. this form of captcha requires entering a sequence of letters or numbers from a distorted image. because the test is administered by a computer, in contrast to the standard turing test that is administered by a human, captchas are sometimes described as reverse turing tests. two widely used captcha services are google's recaptcha and the independent hcaptcha. it takes the average person approximately 10 seconds to solve a typical captcha."
cognition network technology,"cognition network technology cnt, also known as definiens cognition network technology, is an object-based image analysis method developed by nobel laureate gerd binnig together with a team of researchers at definiens ag in munich, germany. it serves for extracting information from images using a hierarchy of image objects groups of pixels, as opposed to traditional pixel processing methods. to emulate the human mind's cognitive powers, definiens used patented image segmentation and classification processes, and developed a method to render knowledge in a semantic network. cnt examines pixels not in isolation, but in context. it builds up a picture iteratively, recognizing groups of pixels as objects. it uses the color, shape, texture and size of objects as well as their context and relationships to draw conclusions and inferences, similar to human analysis."
color histogram,"in image processing and photography, a color histogram is a representation of the distribution of colors in an image. for digital images, a color histogram represents the number of pixels that have colors in each of a fixed list of color ranges, that span the image's color space, the set of all possible colors. the color histogram can be built for any kind of color space, although the term is more often used for three-dimensional spaces such as rgb or hsv. for monochromatic images, the term intensity histogram may be used instead. for multi-spectral images, where each pixel is represented by an arbitrary number of measurements for example, beyond the three measurements in rgb, the color histogram is n-dimensional, with n being the number of measurements taken. each measurement has its own wavelength range of the light spectrum, some of which may be outside the visible spectrum. if the set of possible color values is sufficiently small, each of those colors may be placed on a range by itself then the histogram is merely the count of pixels that have each possible color. most often, the space is divided into an appropriate number of ranges, often arranged as a regular grid, each containing many similar color values. the color histogram may also be represented and displayed as a smooth function defined over the color space that approximates the pixel counts. like other kinds of histograms, the color histogram is a statistic that can be viewed as an approximation of an underlying continuous distribution of color values."
color normalization,"color normalization is a topic in computer vision concerned with artificial color vision and object recognition. in general, the distribution of color values in an image depends on the illumination, which may vary depending on lighting conditions, cameras, and other factors. color normalization allows for object recognition techniques based on color to compensate for these variations."
computational photography,"computational photography refers to digital image capture and processing techniques that use digital computation instead of optical processes. computational photography can improve the capabilities of a camera, or introduce features that were not possible at all with film-based photography, or reduce the cost or size of camera elements. examples of computational photography include in-camera computation of digital panoramas, high-dynamic-range images, and light field cameras. light field cameras use novel optical elements to capture three dimensional scene information which can then be used to produce 3d images, enhanced depth-of-field, and selective de-focusing or ""post focus"". enhanced depth-of-field reduces the need for mechanical focusing systems. all of these features use computational imaging techniques. the definition of computational photography has evolved to cover a number of subject areas in computer graphics, computer vision, and applied optics. these areas are given below, organized according to a taxonomy proposed by shree k. nayar. within each area is a list of techniques, and for each technique one or two representative papers or books are cited. deliberately omitted from the taxonomy are image processing see also digital image processing techniques applied to traditionally captured images in order to produce better images. examples of such techniques are image scaling, dynamic range compression i.e. tone mapping, color management, image completion a.k.a. inpainting or hole filling, image compression, digital watermarking, and artistic image effects. also omitted are techniques that produce range data, volume data, 3d models, 4d light fields, 4d, 6d, or 8d brdfs, or other high-dimensional image-based representations. epsilon photography is a sub-field of computational photography."
computer vision dazzle,"computer vision dazzle, also known as cv dazzle, dazzle makeup, or anti-surveillance makeup, is a type of camouflage used to hamper facial recognition software, inspired by dazzle camouflage used by vehicles such as ships and planes."
condensation algorithm,"the condensation algorithm conditional density propagation is a computer vision algorithm. the principal application is to detect and track the contour of objects moving in a cluttered environment. object tracking is one of the more basic and difficult aspects of computer vision and is generally a prerequisite to object recognition. being able to identify which pixels in an image make up the contour of an object is a non-trivial problem. condensation is a probabilistic algorithm that attempts to solve this problem. the algorithm itself is described in detail by isard and blake in a publication in the international journal of computer vision in 1998. one of the most interesting facets of the algorithm is that it does not compute on every pixel of the image. rather, pixels to process are chosen at random, and only a subset of the pixels end up being processed. multiple hypotheses about what is moving are supported naturally by the probabilistic nature of the approach. the evaluation functions come largely from previous work in the area and include many standard statistical approaches. the original part of this work is the application of particle filter estimation techniques. the algorithms creation was inspired by the inability of kalman filtering to perform object tracking well in the presence of significant background clutter. the presence of clutter tends to produce probability distributions for the object state which are multi-modal and therefore poorly modeled by the kalman filter. the condensation algorithm in its most general form requires no assumptions about the probability distributions of the object or measurements."
connected-component labeling,"connected-component labeling ccl, connected-component analysis cca, blob extraction, region labeling, blob discovery, or region extraction is an algorithmic application of graph theory, where subsets of connected components are uniquely labeled based on a given heuristic. connected-component labeling is not to be confused with segmentation. connected-component labeling is used in computer vision to detect connected regions in binary digital images, although color images and data with higher dimensionality can also be processed. when integrated into an image recognition system or human-computer interaction interface, connected component labeling can operate on a variety of information. blob extraction is generally performed on the resulting binary image from a thresholding step, but it can be applicable to gray-scale and color images as well. blobs may be counted, filtered, and tracked. blob extraction is related to but distinct from blob detection."
contextual image classification,"contextual image classification, a topic of pattern recognition in computer vision, is an approach of classification based on contextual information in images. ""contextual"" means this approach is focusing on the relationship of the nearby pixels, which is also called neighbourhood. the goal of this approach is to classify the images by using the contextual information."
convolutional layer,"in artificial neural networks, a convolutional layer is a type of network layer that applies a convolution operation to the input. convolutional layers are some of the primary building blocks of convolutional neural networks cnns, a class of neural network most commonly applied to images, video, audio, and other data that have the property of uniform translational symmetry. the convolution operation in a convolutional layer involves sliding a small window called a kernel or filter across the input data and computing the dot product between the values in the kernel and the input at each position. this process creates a feature map that represents detected features in the input."
convolutional neural network,"a convolutional neural network cnn is a regularized type of feedforward neural network that learns features by itself via filter or kernel optimization. this type of deep learning network has been applied to process and make predictions from many different types of data including text, images and audio. convolution-based networks are the de-facto standard in deep learning-based approaches to computer vision and image processing, and have only recently been replacedin some casesby newer deep learning architectures such as the transformer. vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, seen during backpropagation in earlier neural networks, are prevented by using regularized weights over fewer connections. for example, for each neuron in the fully-connected layer, 10,000 weights would be required for processing an image sized 100 100 pixels. however, applying cascaded convolution or cross-correlation kernels, only 25 weights for each convolutional layer are required to process 5x5-sized tiles. higher-layer features are extracted from wider context windows, compared to lower-layer features. some applications of cnns include image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, braincomputer interfaces, and financial time series. cnns are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks, based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input. feedforward neural networks are usually fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. the ""full connectivity"" of these networks makes them prone to overfitting data. typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include penalizing parameters during training such as weight decay or trimming connectivity skipped connections, dropout, etc. robust datasets also increase the probability that cnns will learn the generalized principles that characterize a given dataset rather than the biases of a poorly-populated set. convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. the receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field. cnns use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. this means that the network learns to optimize the filters or kernels through automated learning, whereas in traditional algorithms these filters are hand-engineered. this simplifies and automates the process, enhancing efficiency and scalability overcoming human-intervention bottlenecks."
cuboid computer vision,"in computer vision, the term cuboid is used to describe a small spatiotemporal volume extracted for purposes of behavior recognition. the cuboid is regarded as a basic geometric primitive type and is used to depict three-dimensional objects within a three dimensional representation of a flat, two dimensional image."
cyclodisparity,"in vision science, cyclodisparity is the difference in the rotation angle of an object or scene viewed by the left and right eyes. cyclodisparity can result from the eyes' torsional rotation cyclorotation or can be created artificially by presenting to the eyes two images that need to be rotated relative to each other for binocular fusion to take place."
digital image processing,"digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm. as a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. it allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and distortion during processing. since images are defined over two dimensions perhaps more, digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems. the generation and development of digital image processing are mainly affected by three factors first, the development of computers second, the development of mathematics especially the creation and improvement of discrete mathematics theory and third, the demand for a wide range of applications in environment, agriculture, military, industry and medical science has increased."
document mosaicing,"document mosaicing is a process that stitches multiple, overlapping snapshot images of a document together to produce one large, high resolution composite. the document is slid under a stationary, over-the-desk camera by hand until all parts of the document are snapshotted by the camera's field of view. as the document slid under the camera, all motion of the document is coarsely tracked by the vision system. the document is periodically snapshotted such that the successive snapshots are overlap by about 50. the system then finds the overlapped pairs and stitches them together repeatedly until all pairs are stitched together as one piece of document. the document mosaicing can be divided into four main processes. tracking feature detecting correspondences establishing images mosaicing."
dynamic graphics project,"the dynamic graphics project commonly referred to as dgp is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the university of toronto devoted to projects involving computer graphics, computer vision, human computer interaction, and visualization. the lab began as the computer graphics research group of computer science professor leslie mezei in 1967. mezei invited bill buxton, a pioneer of humancomputer interaction to join. in 1972, ronald baecker, another hci pioneer joined dgp, establishing dgp as the first canadian university group focused on computer graphics and human-computer interaction. according to csrankings.org, for the combined subfields of computer graphics, hci, and visualization the dgp is the number one research institution in the world. since then, dgp has hosted many well known faculty and students in computer graphics, computer vision and hci e.g., alain fournier, bill reeves, jos stam, demetri terzopoulos, marilyn tremaine. dgp also occasionally hosts artists in residence e.g., oscar-winner chris landreth. many past and current researchers at autodesk and before that alias wavefront graduated after working at dgp. dgp is located in the st. george campus of university of toronto in the bahen centre for information technology. dgp researchers regularly publish at acm siggraph, acm sigchi and iccv. dgp hosts the toronto user experience tux speaker series and the sanders series lectures."
dynamic texture,"dynamic texture sometimes referred to as temporal texture is the texture with motion which can be found in videos of sea-waves, fire, smoke, wavy trees, etc. dynamic texture has a spatially repetitive pattern with time-varying visual pattern. modeling and analyzing dynamic texture is a topic of images processing and pattern recognition in computer vision. extracting features that describe the dynamic texture can be utilized for tasks of images sequences classification, segmentation, recognition and retrieval. comparing with texture found within static images, analyzing dynamic texture is a challenging problem. it is important that the extracted features from dynamic texture combine motion and appearance description, and also be invariance to some transformation such as rotation, translation and illumination."
efficientnet,"efficientnet is a family of convolutional neural networks cnns for computer vision published by researchers at google ai in 2019. its key innovation is compound scaling, which uniformly scales all dimensions of depth, width, and resolution using a single parameter. efficientnet models have been adopted in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation."
egocentric vision,"egocentric vision or first-person vision is a sub-field of computer vision that entails analyzing images and videos captured by a wearable camera, which is typically worn on the head or on the chest and naturally approximates the visual field of the camera wearer. consequently, visual data capture the part of the scene on which the user focuses to carry out the task at hand and offer a valuable perspective to understand the user's activities and their context in a naturalistic setting. the wearable camera looking forwards is often supplemented with a camera looking inward at the user's eye and able to measure a user's eye gaze, which is useful to reveal attention and to better understand the user's activity and intentions."
eigenface,an eigenface eye-gn- is the name given to a set of eigenvectors when used in the computer vision problem of human face recognition. the approach of using eigenfaces for recognition was developed by sirovich and kirby and used by matthew turk and alex pentland in face classification. the eigenvectors are derived from the covariance matrix of the probability distribution over the high-dimensional vector space of face images. the eigenfaces themselves form a basis set of all images used to construct the covariance matrix. this produces dimension reduction by allowing the smaller set of basis images to represent the original training images. classification can be achieved by comparing how faces are represented by the basis set.
eigenmoments,"eigenmoments is a set of orthogonal, noise robust, invariant to rotation, scaling and translation and distribution sensitive moments. their application can be found in signal processing and computer vision as descriptors of the signal or image. the descriptors can later be used for classification purposes. it is obtained by performing orthogonalization, via eigen analysis on geometric moments."
elastix image registration,"elastix is an image registration toolbox built upon the insight segmentation and registration toolkit itk. it is entirely open-source and provides a wide range of algorithms employed in image registration problems. its components are designed to be modular to ease a fast and reliable creation of various registration pipelines tailored for case-specific applications. it was first developed by stefan klein and marius staring under the supervision of josien p.w. pluim at image sciences institute isi. its first version was command-line based, allowing the final user to employ scripts to automatically process big data-sets and deploy multiple registration pipelines with few lines of code. nowadays, to further widen its audience, a version called simpleelastix is also available, developed by kasper marstal, which allows the integration of elastix with high level languages, such as python, java, and r."
error level analysis,error level analysis ela is the analysis of compression artifacts in digital data with lossy compression such as jpeg.
extensible device metadata,"the extensible device metadata xdm specification is an open file format for embedding device-related metadata in jpeg and other common image files without breaking compatibility with ordinary image viewers. the metadata types include depth map, camera pose, point cloud, lens model, image reliability data, and identifying info about the hardware components. this metadata can be used, for instance, to create depth effects such as a bokeh filter, recreate the exact location and position of the camera when the picture was taken, or create 3d data models of environments or objects. the format uses xml and is based on the xmp standard. it can support multiple ""cameras"" image sources and types in a single image file, and each can include data about its position and orientation relative to the primary camera. a camera data structure may include an image, depth map, etc. the xdm 1.0 documentation uses jpeg as the basic model, but states that the concepts generally apply to other image-file types supported by xmp, including png, tiff, and gif. the xdm specification is developed and maintained by a working group that includes engineers from intel and google. the version 1.01 specification is posted at the website xdm.org an earlier 1.0 version was posted at the intel website in late 2015. xdm builds upon the depthmap metadata specification, introduced in 2014 and used in commercial applications including google lens blur and intel realsense depth enabled photography dep. that original specification was designed only for depth-photography use cases. due to changes and expansions of the data structure, and the use of different namespaces, the two standards are not compatible. existing applications that used that older standard will not work with xdm without modifications."

facial age estimation,"facial age estimation is the use of artificial intelligence to estimate the age of a person based on their facial features. computer vision techniques are used to analyse the facial features in the images of millions of people whose age is known and then deep learning is used to create an algorithm that tries to predict the age of an unknown person. the key use of the technology is to prevent access to age-restricted goods and services. examples include restricting children from accessing internet pornography, checking that they meet a mandatory minimum age when registering for an account on social media, or preventing adults from accessing websites, online chat or games designed only for use by children. the technology is distinct from facial recognition systems as the software does not attempt to uniquely identify the individual. researchers have applied neural networks for age estimation since at least 2010."
geometric hashing,"in computer science, geometric hashing is a method for efficiently finding two-dimensional objects represented by discrete points that have undergone an affine transformation, though extensions exist to other object representations and transformations. in an off-line step, the objects are encoded by treating each pair of points as a geometric basis. the remaining points can be represented in an invariant fashion with respect to this basis using two parameters. for each point, its quantized transformed coordinates are stored in the hash table as a key, and indices of the basis points as a value. then a new pair of basis points is selected, and the process is repeated. in the on-line recognition step, randomly selected pairs of data points are considered as candidate bases. for each candidate basis, the remaining data points are encoded according to the basis and possible correspondences from the object are found in the previously constructed table. the candidate basis is accepted if a sufficiently large number of the data points index a consistent object basis. geometric hashing was originally suggested in computer vision for object recognition in 2d and 3d, but later was applied to different problems such as structural alignment of proteins."
